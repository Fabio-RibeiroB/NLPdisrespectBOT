# Sentimental Analysis Discord bot
To run, create a `.env` with TOKEN=YOUR-BOT-TOKEN.
The bot reads user's messages only, going back by a specified amount.
Trigger the NLP with $disresepct [ENTER NO.].
E.g. $disrespect 10, to read the last 10 messages.
The output is board of the most negative users in the text channel.
